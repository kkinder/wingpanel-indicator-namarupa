# ![icon](data/icon.png) Wingpanel Namarupa Indicator

![Screenshot](data/shot.png)

## Name Inspiration

The name Namarupa is used for the forces at play that govern the Ayatana, in Buddhism. Since this indicator manages the system tray icons which are under the Ayatana project, it seems clever to name this Namarupa.

## Installation
### For users

You'll need the latest debian file (.deb) in our releases tab (TBD) and [this patched indicator-applications debian file](https://github.com/mdh34/elementary-indicators/releases), both installed.
